= Introduction =

The current python-ntlm trunk code supports writing clients connecting to a server.

Issue 4 is about being able to write server-side code that will authenticate clients.

Work has been done on this in the [http://python-ntlm.googlecode.com/svn/branches/clientserver/ clientserver branch].
This now has:
  * Support for NTLM version 1 and version 2
  * Support for client and server operation
  * A sample server that can be used for testing
  * A large number of tests, which all pass

This amounts to a large rewrite of sections of the code, so we need to
clean things up and discuss how/if this could be merged onto trunk.
